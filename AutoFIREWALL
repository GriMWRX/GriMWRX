In this code I am attempting to try and automate firewall updates to help keep your system up to date, 
I attempted to accomplish this by branching off a code I found and trying to put my own flare into it from what I have read about migration of firewalls before trying to automate you need to convert the files to CSV files so the script I found I will include I made some Mods to it.
The source can be found on https://securearmor.wordpress.com/. 


Before running this script though I did do some more research and found that you are going to want to separate hosts, Network Groups, Services objects, 
services group and policies from configuration files.

Here is the Script to convert files to CSV files I modded it a little so I will need help with the automation portion:

# Parse Hosts and Networks
import re
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("file", type=str, help="Export containing all hosts and networks")
args = parser.parse_args()

#Read raw exports
export = open(args.file)

#Files to store results
hosts = open("Enter your own file where you want results to go to", "w")
networks = open("Enter your own file where you want results to go to", "w")

#Write the headers into result files
newline = "\n"
hosts.write("name,ip-address,ignore-warnings" + newline)
networks.write("name,subnet,subnet-mask,ignore-warnings" + newline)

pattern - re.compile(r'^ (set address) (".+?) (".+?) (\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+) (\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+) (".+?)?[\s]?$')
names = []
#Read each line in raw exports
for line in export:
    match = pattern.match(line)
    if match == None:
        print(line)
        continue;
    else:
        name = re.sub(r'[,/]','_', match.group(3))
        if name in names:
            print("All Duplicate names found: " + name)
            print("Duplicates removed.")
            continue
        else:
            names.append(name)
        if match.group(9) == "Enter your IP or the IP your using Or 255.255.255.255":
            result = [name, match.group(6),'true ']
            hosts.write(",".join(result) + newline)
        else:
            result = [name, match.group(6), match.group(9),'true ']
            networks.write(",".join(result) + newline)

#Done. Close all of your files
export.close()
hosts.close()
networks.close()

I hope this is helpful in the migration and automation process that I am trying to create to automatically update your systems Firewall
